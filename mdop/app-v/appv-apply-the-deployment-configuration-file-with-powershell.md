# How to Apply the Deployment Configuration File by Using Windows PowerShell

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10, version 1607

The dynamic deployment configuration file is applied when a package is added or set to a computer running the App-V client before the package has been published. The file configures the default settings for package for all users on the computer running the App-V client. This section describes the steps used to use a deployment configuration file. The procedure is based on the following example and assumes the following package and configuration files exist on a computer:

**c:\\Packages\\Contoso\\MyApp.appv**

**c:\\Packages\\Contoso\\DynamicConfigurations\\deploymentconfig.xml**

**To Apply the Deployment Configuration File Using Windows PowerShell**

-   To specify a new default set of configurations for all users who will run the package on a specific computer, in a Windows PowerShell console, type the following:

    `Add-AppVClientPackage -Path c:\Packages\Contoso\MyApp.appv -DynamicDeploymentConfiguration c:\Packages\Contoso\DynamicConfigurations\deploymentconfig.xml`

    **Note**<br>
    This command captures the resulting object into $pkg. If the package is already present on the computer, the **Set-AppVclientPackage** cmdlet can be used to apply the deployment configuration document:

    `Set-AppVClientPackage -Name Myapp -Path c:\Packages\Contoso\MyApp.appv -DynamicDeploymentConfiguration c:\Packages\Contoso\DynamicConfigurations\deploymentconfig.xml`
