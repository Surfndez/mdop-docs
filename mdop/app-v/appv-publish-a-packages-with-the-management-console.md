# How to Publish a Package by Using the Management Console

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10, version 1607

Use the following procedure to publish an App-V package. Once you publish a package, computers that are running the App-V client can access and run the applications in that package.

**Note**  
The ability to enable only administrators to publish or unpublish packages (described below) is supported starting in App-V 5.0 SP3.

 

**To publish an App-V package**

1.  In the App-V Management console. Click or right-click the name of the package to be published. Select **Publish**.

2.  Review the **Status** column to verify that the package has been published and is now available. If the package is available, the status **published** is displayed.

    If the package is not published successfully, the status **unpublished** is displayed, along with error text that explains why the package is not available.

**To enable only administrators to publish or unpublish packages**

1.  Navigate to the following Group Policy Object node:

    **Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; System &gt; App-V &gt; Publishing**.

2.  Enable the **Require publish as administrator** Group Policy setting.
