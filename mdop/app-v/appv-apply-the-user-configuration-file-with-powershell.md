# How to Apply the User Configuration File by Using Windows PowerShell

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10, version 1607

The dynamic user configuration file is applied when a package is published to a specific user and determines how the package will run.

Use the following procedure to specify a user-specific configuration file. The following procedure is based on the example:

**c:\\Packages\\Contoso\\MyApp.appv**

**To apply a user Configuration file**

1.  To add the package to the computer using the Windows PowerShell console, type the following command:

    `Add-AppVClientPackage c:\Packages\Contoso\MyApp.appv`

2.  Use the following command to publish the package to the user and specify the updated the dynamic user configuration file:

    `Publish-AppVClientPackage $pkg -DynamicUserConfigurationPath c:\Packages\Contoso\config.xml`
