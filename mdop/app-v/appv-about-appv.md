# What's new in App-V for Windows 10, version 1703 and earlier

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10, version 1703 and earlier

Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) helps organizations to deliver Win32 applications to employees as virtual apps. Virtual apps are installed on centrally managed servers and delivered to employees as a service – in real time and on an as-needed basis. Employees start virtual apps from familiar access points and interact with them as if they were installed locally. 

## What's new in App-V Windows 10, version 1703
The following are new features in App-V for Windows 10, version 1703.

### Auto sequence and update your App-V packages singly or as a batch
Previous versions of the App-V Sequencer have required you to manually sequence and update your app packages. This was time-consuming and required extensive interaction, causing many companies to deploy brand-new packages rather than update an existing one. Windows 10, version 1703 introduces the App-V Auto-Sequencer, which automatically sequences your app packages, improving your overall experience by streamlining the provisioning of the prerequisite environment, automating app installation, and expediting the package updating setup.

Using the automatic sequencer to package your apps provides:
-  Automatic virtual machine (VM) provisioning of the sequencing environment. For info about this, see [Automatically provision your sequencing environment using Microsoft Application Virtualization Sequencer (App-V Sequencer)](appv-auto-provision-a-vm.md).

- Batch-sequencing of packages. This means that multiple apps can be sequenced at the same time, in a single group. For info about this, see [Automatically sequence multiple apps at the same time using Microsoft Application Virtualization Sequencer (App-V Sequencer)](appv-auto-batch-sequencing.md).

- Batch-updating of packages. This means that multiple apps can be updated at the same time, in a single group. For info about this, see [Automatically update multiple apps at the same time using Microsoft Application Virtualization Sequencer (App-V Sequencer)](appv-auto-batch-updating.md).

### Updates to the App-V project template
Starting with Windows 10, version 1703, you can save an App-V project template (.appvt) file as part of a sequenced App-V package, so it's automatically loaded every time the package opens for editing or updates. Your template can include general option settings, file exclusion list settings, and target operating system settings. For more info about this, see [Create and apply an App-V project template to a sequenced App-V package](appv-create-and-use-a-project-template.md)

### Automatically cleanup unpublished App-V packages from the App-V client
Previous versions of App-V have required you to manually remove your unpublished packages from your client devices, to free up additional storage space. Windows 10, version 1703 introduces the ability to use PowerShell or Group Policy settings to automatically cleanup your unpublished packages after a device restart. For more info about this, see [Automatically cleanup unpublished packages on the App-V client](appv-auto-clean-unpublished-packages.md)

## What's new in App-V in Windows 10, version 1607
The following are new features in App-V for Windows 10, version 1607.

## App-V is now a feature in Windows 10
With Windows 10, version 1607 and later releases, Application Virtualization (App-V) is included with [Windows 10 for Enterprise and Windows 10 for Education](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/windows-product-home) and is no longer part of the Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack. 

For information about earlier versions of App-V, see [MDOP Information Experience](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/mdop/index).

The changes in App-V for Windows 10, version 1607 impact already existing implementations of App-V in the following ways:

-   The App-V client is installed on user devices automatically with Windows 10, version 1607, and no longer has to be deployed separately. Performing an in-place upgrade to Windows 10, version 1607, on user devices automatically installs the App-V client.

-   The App-V application sequencer is available from the [Windows 10 Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK)](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/windows-assessment-deployment-kit). In previous releases of App-V, the application sequencer was included in the Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack. Although you’ll need to use the new application sequencer to create new virtualized applications, existing virtualized applications will continue to work.

    >[!NOTE]
    >If you're already using App-V 5.x, you don't need to re-deploy the App-V server components as they haven't changed since App-V 5.0 was released. 

For more information about how to configure an existing App-V installation after upgrading user devices to Windows 10, see [Upgrading to App-V for Windows 10 from an existing installation](appv-upgrading-to-app-v-for-windows-10-from-an-existing-installation.md) and [Migrating to App-V for Windows 10 from a previous version](appv-migrating-to-appv-from-a-previous-version.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>You can upgrade your existing App-V installation to Windows 10, version 1607 from App-V versions 5.0 SP2 and higher only. If you are using a previous version of App-V, you’ll need to upgrade from that version to App-V 5.0 SP2 before you upgrade to Windows 10, version 1607.
 
## Support for System Center 
App-V supports System Center 2016 and System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager SP1. See [Planning for App-V Integration with Configuration Manager](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj822982.aspx) for information about integrating your App-V environment with Configuration Manager.
