# How to Publish a Connection Group

>Applies to: Windows 10, version 1607

After you create a connection group, you must publish it to computers that run the App-V client.

## Publish a connection group

1. Open the App-V Management Console and select **CONNECTION GROUPS**.

2. Right-click the connection group to be published, and select **publish**.
