# How to Create a Connection Group with User-Published and Globally Published Packages

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10, version 1607

You can create user-entitled connection groups that contain both user-published and globally published packages, using either of the following methods:

-   [How to use Windows PowerShell cmdlets to create user-entitled connection groups](#how-to-use-windows-powershell-cmdlets-to-create-user-entitled-connection-groups)

-   [How to use the App-V Server to create user-entitled connection groups](#how-to-use-the-app-v-server-to-create-user-entitled-connection-groups)

## What to know before you start:

<tr class="header">

<th align="left">Result</th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>You cannot include user-published packages in globally entitled connection groups.</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>The connection group will fail.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>If you publish a package globally and then create a user-published connection group in which you’ve made that package non-optional, you can still run <strong>Unpublish-AppvClientPackage &lt;package&gt; -global</strong> to unpublish the package, even when that package is being used in another connection group.</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>If any other connection groups are using that package, the package will fail in those connection groups.</p>
<p>To avoid inadvertently unpublishing a non-optional package that is being used in another connection group, we recommend that you track the connection groups in which you’ve used a non-optional package.</p></td>

</tbody>
</table>

 

## How to use Windows PowerShell cmdlets to create user-entitled connection groups

1.  Add and publish packages by using the following commands:
    
    ```
    Add-AppvClientPackage <Package1_AppV_file_Path>
    Add-AppvClientPackage <Package2_AppV_file_Path>
    Publish-AppvClientPackage -PackageId <Package1_ID> -VersionId <Package1_Version_ID> -Global
    Publish-AppvClientPackage -PackageId <Package2_ID> -VersionId <Package2_Version_ID>
    ```

2.  Create the connection group XML file. For more information, see [About the Connection Group File](appv-connection-group-file.md).

3.  Add and publish the connection group by using the following commands:
    
    ```
    Add-AppvClientConnectionGroup <Connection_Group_XML_file_Path>
    Enable-AppvClientConnectionGroup -GroupId <CG_Group_ID> -VersionId <CG_Version_ID>
    ```

## How to use the App-V Server to create user-entitled connection groups

1.  Open the App-V Management Console.

2.  Follow the instructions in [How to Publish a Package by Using the Management Console](appv-publish-a-packages-with-the-management-console.md) to publish packages globally and to the user.

3.  Follow the instructions in [How to Create a Connection Group](appv-create-a-connection-group.md) to create the connection group, and add the user-published and globally published packages.
